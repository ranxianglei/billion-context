// never gets the BILLION_CONTEXT_PROXY env var (only the `bili pi` launcher
// exports it), so without this check bcp and the proxy both compress every
// request. Mirrors proxyBaseFromUrl in billion-context (src/agent/shared.ts):
// the real prefix embeds the full upstream URL, so require `bili` as the FIRST
// path segment followed by an http(s) URL — a plain `/foo/bili/` path is NOT a
// bili proxy. MITM transparent mode (HTTPS_PROXY) has no /bili/ prefix and
// stays undetectable from the URL; those users must export the env var.
